In order to evaluate whether we've calibrated and selected a 'best' or even 'good' model, we'll need to add another step.  This is **validation** -- we would like to discover if the model we calibrated is still _valid_ when applied to new observations of the predictor.  In statistics, this typically means some form of _cross-validation_, where we withhold some of the available observations, train or calibrate the model on the remained, and then test the ability of the model to predict or estimate the withheld data.  There are various ways to do this and the language used to describe this differs somewhat across fields and between traditional statistics and machine learning, but the goal is the same -- is my model a reasonable and valid one when confronted with data that were not part of the calibration or training of that model?  If the answer is 'no', then it is likely your model is overfit.
