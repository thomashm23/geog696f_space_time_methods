    "Often when programming we need to repeat an operation many times in sequence.  Perhaps we need to repeat an operation a certain number of times, perhaps we need to continue an operation until a certain condition is me, or perhaps one step in a calculation affects the subsequent step.  In this notebook we'll learn the basics of writing `if`, `for` and `while` loops and conditionals in Python."
