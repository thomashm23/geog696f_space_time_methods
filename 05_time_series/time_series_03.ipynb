    "Here we build a function for the Butterworth digital filter.  The function combines several things we need to do for filtering.  First, it determines the normalized cutoff frequency, based on the time steps between samples (the sampling frequency, fs) and the requested cutoff frequency.  The function then gets the coefficients that describe the shape of the Butterworth filter itself.  The function also pads the data at either end, which helps minimiize end effects from the filtering.  The function then applies `filtfilt`, which pass the Butterworth filter we designed forward and backward over the time series (this improve the phase of the filter).  Finally, it removes the padding and returns the Pandas series with its datetime index intact:"
